A. Project Overview Brief description of the project -
This project uses Teachable Machine to build an AI model that can identify different types of creeper plants. The dataset includes 5,000 images in total, with 250 images for each plant type to keep the training balanced and fair. Each photo shows the plants from different angles, under different lighting, and against varied backgrounds, so the model can learn to recognize them in real-world situations.

The images are carefully labeled and uploaded to Teachable Machine for training, testing, and validation. The goal is to create a model that can automatically recognize creeper plants based on their leaves, stems, and growth patterns. This makes identification faster, more consistent, and less prone to errors than doing it manually.

Because every plant type has the same number of images, the model is less likely to be biased and more reliable. Once trained, this model can be used for educational purposes, plant identification, or just as a hands-on example of computer vision in action.

Purpose of the Image Classification Model

The purpose of this project is to make it easy to recognize and classify creeper plants using AI. By training the model with a balanced set of 5,000 images, it learns to notice details like leaf shapes, vine structures, and textures.

The model can automatically categorize plants without manual checking, saving time and ensuring consistency. Beyond plant identification, this project is a great way to demonstrate machine learning concepts, practice AI training, and create interactive educational tools.

Common Name: Dendrobium Orchid
Scientific Name: Dendrobium spp.

Dendrobium orchids are epiphytic creeper plants belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). They grow long, slender stems (or canes) with narrow, elongated leaves, and produce striking clusters of flowers that often hang gracefully from the stems. Flower colors can vary widely depending on the species, including shades of white, pink, purple, and yellow.

Dendrobium orchids thrive in bright, indirect light and prefer well-draining orchid medium such as bark or sphagnum moss. They enjoy moderate to high humidity and benefit from regular watering during active growth periods, while allowing the medium to dry slightly between waterings. These orchids are sensitive to extreme cold and require warm temperatures to bloom optimally.

For image classification or machine learning projects, Dendrobium orchids are ideal because of their distinctive long canes, leaf shapes, and hanging flower clusters, making them easy to identify visually as an orchid creeper plant.

REFLECTION QUESTIONS :

1.How did the number of images per class affect your model’s accuracy?

Answer: It has a big impact on how well the model learns.

2.Which plant species were most commonly misclassified and why?

Answer: Calanthe species are often misclassified because many have similar flowers and leaves, show variations in different environments, and can naturally hybridize, 
making them hard to distinguish.

3.How did changing the epochs, batch size, or learning rate affect the training results?

Answer: After adjusting those settings, the training results have become more accurate and reliable.

4.What challenges did you encounter during dataset collection and labeling?

Answer: The dataset was very large, making the process of labeling each entry time-consuming and tiring.

5.If you were to improve your model, what specific changes would you make and why?

Answer: I would adjust the number of epochs, as the current model tends to misclassify some of the input images, and more training could improve its accuracy.
